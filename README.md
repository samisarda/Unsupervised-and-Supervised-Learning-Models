This study investigates the determinants of adoption of insulin pumps among patients managing chronic health conditions with specific focus on diabetes. We have used synthetically generated data that replicates actual healthcare settings, the examination explores the associations between the socio-demographic patient characteristics, socio-economic status, clinical predictors, and adoption of insulin pumps. This study uses a comprehensive analytical approach with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), k-means, hierarchical clustering, and other classification models such as logistic regression, decision tree analysis, neural networks, and support vector machines. PCA revealed monthly income, count of chronic conditions, and awareness of devices to be significant factors of patient heterogeneity. Clustering algorithms accurately segmented patients into different profiles with varying probabilities of adoption, and they pointed to the role of socio-economic and health determinants in influencing purchasing behavior. Logistic regression models and decision tree models confirmed doctor recommendation, income level, and HbA1c as the most statistically significant predictors of adoption. Neural networks demonstrated superior accuracy, by achieving an AUC of 0.8678 on
the validation set, and lift curve analysis also suggested that focusing on the top 20% of predicted adopters could more than double the efficiency of intervention strategies. This study emphasizes the efficacy of predictive analytics as a tool for facilitating inclusive health interventions, optimized marketing with improved targeting of medical device marketers, and data-driven policy making. By the identification of high-probability adopter segments and key influence factors, this study contributes to the overall aim of enhancing chronic disease management by leveraging effective and cost-effective technological interventions.
